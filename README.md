# the-key-metrics-for-KK
KK is the Chinese version of Discord, so it contains a lot of channels. 
I define some metrics to check whether it meets the business goals.

There are some key metrics for KK below:
a) How many users are in this channel 
b) How many users join this channel
c) How many users quit this channel
d) How many active users are in this channel
e) How many users communicate with each other
f) How many messages are in this channel
g) Average active time per user

Based on these key metrics above, I could provide data-driven solutions to operation team to suggest them how to improve the performance of KK
